Information about Enigma:

The enigma machines were electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed by
Arthur Scherbius in 1918. They were most notably used by Germany to encrypt military
messages during WWII. The enigma machine is a mechanically operated device with an
electrical signal passing through its wires and mechanical parts. Its components
consisted of a keyboard, a plugboard, a static rotor, scramblers, a reflector, and
a lamp board. The static rotor, scramblers, and reflector are all contained in the
‘rotors’ component. The key-space of the Enigma cipher consists of several things:
the rotors and their order, the 3 letter indicator settings, the 3 letter ring settings,
and the plug board settings. The total number of ways you can set the enigma machine
was 158,962,555,217,826,360,000.
