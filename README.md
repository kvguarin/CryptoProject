This is an Enigma emulator written in Python2.

To run in Terminal:
	python2 enigma.py 

The enigma machines were electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed by Arthur Scherbius in 1918. They were most notably used by Germany to encrypt military messages during WWII.

The enigma machine is a mechanically operated device with an electrical signal passing through its wires and mechanical parts. Its components consisted of a keyboard, a plugboard, a static rotor, scramblers, a reflector, and a lampboard. The static rotor, scramblers, and reflector are all contained in the ‘rotors’ component.

The keyspace of the Enigma cipher consists of several things: the rotors and their order, the 3 letter indicator settings, the 3 letter ring settings, and the plugboard settings.

The total number of ways you can set the enigma machine was 158,962,555,217,826,360,000.
